# Node.js Server Missing Response Headers

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js servers where the response headers are missing, leading to connection issues. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The server in `bug.js` omits setting the status code and headers before sending the response.  This results in a broken connection from the client's perspective, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file corrects the issue by explicitly setting the status code and `Content-Type` header. This ensures a proper HTTP response is sent to the client, maintaining the connection and delivering the expected content.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Attempt to access the server (e.g., using `curl http://localhost:3000` or a browser).
5. Observe the error (e.g., incomplete or missing response).
6. Run `node bugSolution.js` and repeat step 4. Observe a successful response.

This example highlights the importance of properly setting the response headers in Node.js HTTP servers.
